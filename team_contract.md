# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

Sat: 2 PM-4PM
Wednesday: 3PM-5 PM

2. **Assistance** 

We will use a group chat on WhatsApp to communicate our weekly progress outside of meetings and approach each other through it.

We will make use of Google Calendar to keep track of important deadlines and keep ourselves organized.
They should be expected to respond within a day.


3. **Respect** 

We will respect each other and their opinions, consider everyone’s suggestions equally, and make sure that every team member has full ownership of their contributions to the codebase.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 

Coding:
Pseudocode/Algorithm research: Sidharth, Deepit

Implementation: Harsh, Naman

Integration/clean-up: Deepit, Sidharth, Harsh, Naman
	Since Harsh and Naman’s strength is in implementation and bug-fixing (from experience with previous MPs), coding roadblocks would be first resolved by them, then consulted on by other team members.

Weekly Logs and Final Presentation: The workload would be equally distributed among the 4 depending on the week and the part of the presentation to contribute to.


5. **Time Commitment** 
	We all will spend 2hrs/per week in meetings and 1-1.5 hrs outside of meeting times collaborating on code, creating the final presentation, and weekly logs.


6. **Conflict Resolution** 
	If there is a conflict, we would resort to asking all the team members their views on the topic, and then make a collective decision.
